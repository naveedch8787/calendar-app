# CalendarApp

CalendarApp is an Angular application that allows users to manage meeting and view them in a calendar format. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` to generate other code artifacts.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use `ng build --prod` for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This will ensure that all unit tests pass and the application behaves as expected.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. Make sure to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities, such as Protractor or Cypress.
